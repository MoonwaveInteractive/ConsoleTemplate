# ConsoleTemplate
An advanced template for getting a complex and robust console application targetting .NET Core up and running as fast as possible.

This template makes light usage of Moonwave.Text for displaying command help information. It is recommended that you implement your own text formatter as Moonwave.Text is currently incapable of text wrapping.
